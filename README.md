A KeyboardAvoidingView that works out of the box. Inspired by [Nick Yang](https://medium.com/@nickyang0501/keyboardavoidingview-not-working-properly-c413c0a200d4)

- Uses a `TouchableWithoutFeedback` wrapper to dismiss the keyboard
- Uses `behavior="padding"` as a consistent default
- Actually works!
